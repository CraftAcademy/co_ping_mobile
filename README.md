### So what is Co-Ping?

Co-Ping is the cooperative shopping app for amazing neighbor's. With it you can announce when you'll go shopping so that a neighbor who may need a few items can request you pick it up for them. Next time, when they go shopping, you may be out of something and they can return the favour. This app is about bringing people in a co-operative or neighborhood closer - one kind gesture at a time (while saving time, money and reducing consumption).

### Let's get started

Clone it down to your local workspace, if more than two Repos we recommend that you start with the API.
